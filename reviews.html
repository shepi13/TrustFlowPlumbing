                    Trevor Scott is an excellent plumber. He is very conscientious and always gives his best
                    effort. He is very knowledgeable in the best methods to use and the equipment necessary to
                    solve any plumbing problem. Trevor carefully explains to the customer the time needed to
                    complete the job and gives a reasonable estimate of the costs after researching to find the
                    best supplies at economical prices.

                    <p>I highly recommend Trevor Scott for the knowledge, persistence and excellence he displays
                    in streamlining the whole process for the benefit of his customer.</p>

                    <p>P.S. He&apos;s also very cute and easy to talk to.</p>

                    <p>Sarah and Trevor were amazing contractors and I would highly recommend them. Their
                    attention to detail was second to none and their work was very professional. I gave them a
                    series of repairs that were performed in different phases as per my request. Prior to each
                    project, I was supplied with before pictures as well as a clear scope of work. Since I live in a
                    different state communication was key and Sarah was phenomenal. Once the work was
                    completed, I was supplied with post-work completion photos.</p>

                    <p>Some of the work performed was updating plumbing of the master and 2nd bathroom, as
                    well as other minor repairs and maintenance. They also took an overall assessment of the
                    house and provided me with a list of options and preventative maintenance since I did not
                    live locally, and it was greatly appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Sarah and Trevor were extremely accommodating and always on time. It is very comforting
                    to have an honest contractor locally that I know I can depend on. Thank you both!"</p>

                    Hello. My name is Laura Grady from Rotonda West. I would like to profess my undying
                    allegiance to this company! I can&apos;t tell you how many times they have saved me from horrible
                    catastrophes. This company is honest, diligent, reasonably priced, and caring. One can&apos;t
                    ask for more. I wouldn&apos;t consider another company for my needs. Since the first service call,
                    I KNEW I had a great thing going with them. I am a customer for life!

                    Trevor has been my plumber for several years. I also know Sarah his wife. Every time I've
                    called for service or referenced him to someone; he comes right away. He is so
                    knowledgeable in his field and Sarah handles scheduling and keeps me abreast of arrival
                    time, delay, etc. No wondering if you've called the right person. Trevor has always been fair
                    in his cost estimates. This plumber is my go-to for my house and condo. I could say more
                    about this couple. I value their integrity above all.

                    Trevor and Sarah did excellent work at my house. They gave me a quick assessment of what
                    needed to be done as well as what they would charge. They also gave me options on how to
                    lower the price. Trevor was able to fit my work into his schedule promptly. Thank you, Sarah
                    and Trevor, for your abilities and I look forward to seeing you again for the project we put on
                    pause.
