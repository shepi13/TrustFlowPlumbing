            <p>
                We specialize in immediate response and Emergency Repairs, to help get your household plumbing 
                system back up and running. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since these issues come up at inopportune times (middle of the night, holidays, etc.) 
                we can help during these inconveniences. These repairs are often just temporary band-aids, until a more permanent 
                solution can be resolved, which can be scheduled for a more convenient time.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Oftentimes other plumbing repairs are needed that are not urgent yet but may be tackled 
                before they become emergencies. Most plumbing is out of sight, out of mind and therefore 
                easy to forget about. 
            </p>
            <p>These would include major and minor repairs such as pipe and fixture 
                corrosion, small leaks, clogs, drain line replacement, etc.
