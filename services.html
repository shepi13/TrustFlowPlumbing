            <p>
                We specialize in immediate response and Emergency Repairs, to help get your household plumbing 
                system back up and running. Since these issues come up at inopportune times (middle of the night, holidays, etc.) 
                we can help during these inconveniences. These repairs are often just temporary band-aids, until a more permanent 
                solution can be resolved, which can be scheduled for a more convenient time.

                We also cater towards the replacement of old fixtures that are beyond repair, 
                or if they just need an update anywhere inside or outside the home. 
                New fixtures can also be installed. Many clients are interested in 
                upgrading their home by adding new features, such as water lines out to a 
                dock or shed or relocating a utility sink in a garage.

            <p>
                Oftentimes other plumbing repairs are needed that are not urgent yet but may be tackled 
                before they become emergencies. Most plumbing is out of sight, out of mind and therefore 
                easy to forget about. These would include major and minor repairs such as pipe and fixture 
                corrosion, small leaks, clogs, drain line replacement, etc.

            <h2>Re-Pipes (Partial or Whole House)</h2>
            <p>
                All plumbing systems age and will eventually need to be replaced. Common causes that require a 
                re-pipe include corroded copper or galvanized piping, brittle CPVC, or worn-out fittings. Instead 
                of chipping up the home’s foundation for a localized repair, it is often more cost and time-effective 
                to replace all the water piping with state-of-the-art Pex-A Uponor piping. This piping would be 
                installed in the attic as opposed to underground and would only require minimal drywall removal 
                for plumbing access. (Re-pipes do not include any drywall repair). All whole house re-pipes require 
                a permit and inspection, to ensure that your home’s potable water system has been brought up to 
                national code requirements.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Re-pipes include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All Piping Replaced with New Uponor Pex-A (25-Year Manufacturer’s Warranty)</li>
                <li>New Outdoor Main Water Service</li>
                <li>New Outdoor Hose Bibs with Vacuum Breakers</li>
                <li>New Local Shut-Off Valves & Water Supply Lines at Every Fixture</li>
                <li>New Recessed Ice Line to Refrigerator (Where Applicable)</li>
                <li>New Recessed Washing Machine Outlet Box (Where Applicable)</li>
                <li>All Outdoor Pipes Will be Painted (Can Color Match)</li>
                <li>
                    Existing Shower Valves Will Be Tied into the New Uponor Pex-A System 
                    (This is the only tiny section of original piping that will be left 
                    until the valve is replaced) 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optional Upgrades That Can be Installed During the Re-pipe at a Reduced Rate 
                    if Needed or Desired (Must be disclosed ahead of time):
                    <ul>
                        <li>New Shower Valves</li>
                        <li>New Water Heaters</li>
                        <li>New Faucets</li>
