                <h1>Re-Pipes (Partial or Whole House)</h1>
                <p>
                    All plumbing systems age and will eventually need to be replaced. Common causes that require a 
                    re-pipe include corroded copper or galvanized piping, brittle CPVC, or worn-out fittings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of chipping up the home’s foundation for a localized repair, it is often more cost and time-effective 
                    to replace all the water piping with state-of-the-art Pex-A Uponor piping. This piping would be 
                    installed in the attic as opposed to underground and would only require minimal drywall removal 
                    for plumbing access. 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    All whole house re-pipes require 
                    a permit and inspection, to ensure that your home’s potable water system has been brought up to 
                    national code requirements.
