            <h2>Re-Pipes (Partial or Whole House)</h2>
            <p>
                All plumbing systems age and will eventually need to be replaced. Common causes that require a 
                re-pipe include corroded copper or galvanized piping, brittle CPVC, or worn-out fittings. Instead 
                of chipping up the home’s foundation for a localized repair, it is often more cost and time-effective 
                to replace all the water piping with state-of-the-art Pex-A Uponor piping. This piping would be 
                installed in the attic as opposed to underground and would only require minimal drywall removal 
                for plumbing access. (Re-pipes do not include any drywall repair). All whole house re-pipes require 
                a permit and inspection, to ensure that your home’s potable water system has been brought up to 
                national code requirements.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Re-pipes include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All Piping Replaced with New Uponor Pex-A (25-Year Manufacturer’s Warranty)</li>
                <li>New Outdoor Main Water Service</li>
                <li>New Outdoor Hose Bibs with Vacuum Breakers</li>
                <li>New Local Shut-Off Valves & Water Supply Lines at Every Fixture</li>
                <li>New Recessed Ice Line to Refrigerator (Where Applicable)</li>
                <li>New Recessed Washing Machine Outlet Box (Where Applicable)</li>
                <li>All Outdoor Pipes Will be Painted (Can Color Match)</li>
                <li>
                    Existing Shower Valves Will Be Tied into the New Uponor Pex-A System 
                    (This is the only tiny section of original piping that will be left 
                    until the valve is replaced) 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optional Upgrades That Can be Installed During the Re-pipe at a Reduced Rate 
                    if Needed or Desired (Must be disclosed ahead of time):
                    <ul>
                        <li>New Shower Valves</li>
                        <li>New Water Heaters</li>
                        <li>New Faucets</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
