                Trevor and Sarah got started with Trustflow Plumbing at the very end of 2021 and were very much a mom-&-pop 
                style business, working out of their home in the Gardens of Gulf Cove in Port Charlotte, Florida. Hurricane 
                Ian in 2022 affected their business plans, as there was such a high demand for home repair services. Their 
                plumbing work took a backseat to the more disastrous concerns of their community, as they turned their focus 
                onto handyman jobs. As well, their house (& home office) had to be gutted after the hurricane. They are still 
                working on rebuilding their house and office, still staying in their GOGC neighborhood.

                However, Trustflow Plumbing still carried on, as plumbing is what Trevor is truly passionate about. He received 
                his associate's degree from Southwest Florida College but was not happy with the hollow expectations of a career 
                after college. He accidentally fell into plumbing after his friend Caleb recommended that he come work with him 
                at his plumbing job with TitanZ Plumbing & Air Conditioning.

                Trevor resisted the notion of learning plumbing at first, leaning more towards the electrical trade. Within the first
                 week he fell in love with plumbing. He rose to the unparalleled challenges that plumbing provides, the hands-on work, 
                 the victory of helping people with their problems, and the satisfaction of learning a skilled trade. Now, he 
                 recommends choosing a skilled trade to anyone who will listen! Trevor saw the opportunity for personal growth within 
                 the industry, and providing a business career for his future that could be within his own realm of influence. And so, 
                 the seeds of Trustflow Plumbing had begun.

                Sarah actually came up with the “Trustflow” name...after running hundreds of options by Trevor. Because while working on 
                jobs in the past, they realized how important trust is for both sides. It can make or break you. Because trust flows both 
                ways. Our Trustflow Plumbing logo is inspired by Key West colors, and the lime green palm trees in the Trustflow “T” gives 
                it a beachy Florida-feel. The faucet in the Plumbing “P” ties in the plumbing business. It is bright and colorful, 
                offering happy rays of light on people’s dark days of plumbing nightmares.

                Trustflow Plumbing has really grown by word of mouth, as well as through the community on the neighborhood app, NextDoor. 
                Even clients who used their handyman services were impressed by their standards and good work ethic and thus have followed 
                up with plumbing work or recommending them to others. It has been a great experience for them. Trevor and Sarah aim to keep 
                on helping their neighbors and community by offering reasonably priced plumbing services, quality work, as well as 
                steadfast dedication to the trade and to their clients.
