                <p>
                    Trevor and Sarah got started with Trustflow Plumbing at the very end of 2021 and were very much a mom-&-pop 
                    style business, working out of their home in the Gardens of Gulf Cove in Port Charlotte, Florida. Hurricane 
                    Ian in 2022 affected their business plans, as there was such a high demand for home repair services. Their 
                    plumbing work took a backseat to the more disastrous concerns of their community, as they turned their focus 
                    onto handyman jobs. As well, their house (& home office) had to be gutted after the hurricane. They are still 
                    working on rebuilding their house and office, still staying in their GOGC neighborhood.

                    <div class="main-text-content story-section">
                        <p>
                            However, Trustflow Plumbing still carried on, as plumbing is what Trevor is truly passionate about. He received 
                            his associate's degree from Southwest Florida College but was not happy with the hollow expectations of a career 
                            after college. He accidentally fell into plumbing after his friend Caleb recommended that he come work with him 
                            at his plumbing job with TitanZ Plumbing & Air Conditioning.  
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="main-text-content story-section">
                        <p>
                            Trevor resisted the notion of learning plumbing at first, leaning more towards the electrical trade. Within the first
                            week he fell in love with plumbing. He rose to the unparalleled challenges that plumbing provides, the hands-on work, 
                            the victory of helping people with their problems, and the satisfaction of learning a skilled trade. Now, he 
                            recommends choosing a skilled trade to anyone who will listen! Trevor saw the opportunity for personal growth within 
                            the industry, and providing a business career for his future that could be within his own realm of influence. And so, 
                            the seeds of Trustflow Plumbing had begun.

                            Trustflow Plumbing has really grown by word of mouth, as well as through the community on the neighborhood app, NextDoor. 
                            Even clients who used their handyman services were impressed by their standards and good work ethic and thus have followed 
                            up with plumbing work or recommending them to others. It has been a great experience for them. Trevor and Sarah aim to keep 
                            on helping their neighbors and community by offering reasonably priced plumbing services, quality work, as well as 
                            steadfast dedication to the trade and to their clients.

                        Sarah actually came up with the “Trustflow” name...after running hundreds of options by Trevor. Because while working on 
                        jobs in the past, they realized how important trust is for both sides. It can make or break you. Because trust flows both 
                        ways.

                        Our Trustflow Plumbing logo is inspired by Key West colors, and the lime green palm trees in the Trustflow “T” gives 
                        it a beachy Florida-feel. The faucet in the Plumbing “P” ties in the plumbing business. It is bright and colorful, 
                        offering happy rays of light on people&apos;s dark days of plumbing nightmares.
