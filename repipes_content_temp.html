    <h2>Re-Pipes (Partial or Whole House)</h2>
    <p>
        All plumbing systems age and will eventually need to be replaced. Common causes that require a 
        re-pipe include corroded copper or galvanized piping, brittle CPVC, or worn-out fittings. Instead 
        of chipping up the home’s foundation for a localized repair, it is often more cost and time-effective 
        to replace all the water piping with state-of-the-art Pex-A Uponor piping. This piping would be 
        installed in the attic as opposed to underground and would only require minimal drywall removal 
        for plumbing access. (Re-pipes do not include any drywall repair). All whole house re-pipes require 
        a permit and inspection, to ensure that your home’s potable water system has been brought up to 
        national code requirements.
